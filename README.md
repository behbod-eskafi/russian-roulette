# russian-roulette

A simple game of russian roulette to play with friends in order to make a decision of who should do something (like washing the dishes :D).

## Classic Game

Each players take turn and insert numbers in mathematical order, whichever has the same number as the random-generated number looses.

(ATTENTION: in this game player must determine the turns outside of this area.)

## Advanced Game

In this version of the game, players must insert their names and the turns are determined randomly.

Players can choose any number they want as long as it was not chosen by someone before them.
